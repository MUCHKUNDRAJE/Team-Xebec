## 🔧 Customization

### Change Prediction Window

Edit `predict_cme.py`:

```python
PREDICTION_DAYS = 15  # Change from 30 to 15 days
```

### Adjust Model Architecture

Edit `train_cme_model.py`:

```python
hidden_size = 256      # Increase from 128
num_layers = 6         # Increase from 4
seq_length = 15        # Increase from 10
```

### Modify Ensemble Weights

Edit `predict_cme.py`:

```python
# Current: LSTM 40%, RF 30%, GB 30%
ensemble_pred = 0.5 * lstm_pred + 0.25 * rf_pred + 0.25 * gb_pred
```

## 💾 Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn torch
```

**Versions:**
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- scikit-learn 1.3+
- pandas 2.0+
- numpy 1.24+

## 🔄 Retraining

Retrain when:
- New data available (monthly/quarterly)
- Model accuracy degrades
- Significant solar activity changes

```bash
# Simply re-run training on updated dataset
python train_cme_model.py
```

Models are automatically versioned with timestamps in metadata.

## 📊 Visualization Ready

Output JSON is structured for easy visualization:

```python
import json
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

with open('cme_predictions_30days.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

speeds = [p['cme_parameters']['speed'] for p in data]
dates = [p['time21_5'] for p in data]

plt.plot(dates, speeds)
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Speed (km/s)')
plt.title('Predicted CME Speeds - 30 Days')
plt.show()
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Quality
- Model accuracy depends on training data quality
- Remove outliers and erroneous measurements
- Ensure consistent time coverage

### Limitations
- Predictions are probabilistic, not deterministic
- Confidence decreases with prediction horizon
- Extreme events are harder to predict
- Solar cycle variations affect accuracy

### Production Deployment
- Run predictions daily/weekly for continuous monitoring
- Set up alerting for high-severity predictions
- Log all predictions for accuracy tracking
- Monitor model drift over time

## 📧 Support & Maintenance

### Model Monitoring
Track these metrics monthly:
- Prediction accuracy (actual vs predicted)
- Confidence calibration
- False positive/negative rates
- Speed prediction MAE

### When to Retrain
- MAE increases by >20%
- R² drops below 0.7
- Systematic bias detected
- After 3-6 months

## 🏗️ Architecture Benefits

### Why This Approach Works

1. **More Training Data** (25 years vs 5 years)
   - Captures full solar cycles
   - Includes rare extreme events
   - Better statistical patterns

2. **Ensemble Learning**
   - LSTM learns temporal sequences
   - RF captures non-linear relationships
   - GBM optimizes residual errors
   - Combined: Better than any single model

3. **Production Ready**
   - Separate training/inference
   - Versioned models
   - Metadata tracking
   - Easy to deploy
